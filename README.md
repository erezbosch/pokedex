# Backbone Pokedex (day 2)

**Gotta Fetch 'em All**

A Rails/Backbone app for keeping track of Pokemon and Toys (which belong to Pokemon).
Now with proper Backbone, JST templates and all!

You can:
* Add Pokemon to the list
* View detailed Pokemon info by clicking on them in the list
* View toys for each Pokemon in the detailed info view
* Add more toys for a Pokemon
* Reassign toys from one Pokemon to another
* Edit and delete Pokemon/toys

Use the app by cloning the repo, running `bundle`, running `rake db:setup`, running `rails s` and visiting localhost:3000.
